<p>When it comes to home improvements, there are two big factors to consider when figuring out where to put your money: whether it&rsquo;s something that will increase the value of the house to&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;and whether it&rsquo;s something that will increase the value of the house to&nbsp;<em>others</em>, if and when you decide to&nbsp;sell your home. The most valuable home improvements are those that increase your home&rsquo;s worth in fair relation to the amount you spent on them. And while the improvements that might be most worth it for you personally are subjective and hard to quantify,&nbsp;<em>Remodeling</em>&nbsp;magazine&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="http://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2018/">2018 Cost vs. Value Report</a>&nbsp;offers helpful national data on what home improvements give you the biggest bang for your buck. Here are 6 improvements to focus on.</p>

<h3 class="stage-title">Healthier Water</h3>
<div class="stage-entry">
<p>By filtering chlorine, chloramines, and other contaminants, you'll enjoy cleaner, spring-like water from every tap in the house. Enjoy softer skin and hair, free of the drying effects of chemicals. And savor the difference in the kitchen, by cooking and brewing coffee and tea with tastier, filtered water.</p>

<h2><strong><a href="https://www.airpurifiersrating.com/">Air Purifiers</a><br /></strong></h2>
<p>The promise of an&nbsp;air purifier&nbsp;is an enticing one: An appliance designed to cleanse the air in your home, getting rid of all the impurities including odors, smoke, dust, and pet dander. Given the fact that indoor air can have levels of certain pollutants up to&nbsp;<a class="body-link" href="https://www.epa.gov/report-environment/indoor-air-quality" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.epa.gov/report-environment/indoor-air-quality">five times higher than outdoor air</a>, we get it. But in reality, not all air purifiers necessarily live up to the marketing hype.</p>

<h2><strong><a href="https://www.pressurewashersrating.com/">Pressure Washer</a><br /></strong></h2>
<p>Pressure washers (aka power washers) are so much fun to use&mdash;and show such dramatic and quick results&mdash;that you&rsquo;ll be begging to clean your neighbors&rsquo; siding, driveways and cars once you&rsquo;ve finished your own. You can rent or buy a pressure washer to clean nearly any outdoor item. By following the pressure washer tips in this article, you&rsquo;ll learn how to use pressure washers safely and efficiently.</p>
<p>Pressure washers, whether they&rsquo;re powered by electric motors or gas engines, run a pump that pressurizes the water from your garden hose to 1,000 lbs. or more, then forces it out through a spray wand. The higher the pressure (measured in pounds per square inch&mdash;psi), the tougher the cleaning jobs they can tackle. Both types require a steady, uninterrupted supply of water (in gallons per minute&mdash;gpm). For occasional use, most homeowners will find that a washer with a pressure range of 1,300 to 2,400 psi works best.</p>

<h2><strong>The kitchen (within reason)<br /></strong></h2>
<p>The kitchen is major when it comes to the most valuable home improvements. Buyers often look here first when determining whether a home is worth its asking price, since most people want an upgraded kitchen without having to pay a ton of money to get it after purchasing a house. There are a range of valuable home improvements you can make in the kitchen to fit your particular budget and objectives, from putting in energy-efficient, stainless steel appliances to painting cabinets and installing new countertops.</p>
<p>Interestingly, you don&rsquo;t have to spend big in the kitchen to get a big return. A minor kitchen remodel will recoup about 81 percent of its cost in average resale value, while a major upscale kitchen remodel will recoup only about 53.5 percent of its cost. The most valuable home improvements in a minor kitchen remodel&nbsp;include&nbsp;modernizing the cabinets and countertops, upgrading to brand new appliances, updating the sink and faucet, and updating the flooring.</p>
</li>

<h2><strong>Siding and vinyl window replacements<br /></strong></h2>
<p>Old, damaged, or deteriorating siding can seriously date the look of your house, and not in a charming way. Fortunately, updating your siding is a valuable renovation, bringing in a cost recuperation of 76.7 percent based on a purchase of 1,250 square feet of siding. Just make sure not to neglect the trim, since it&rsquo;s an important factor in making your siding upgrade look its best.</p>
<p>And while you&rsquo;re at it, why not complement upgraded siding with upgraded windows? Low-energy vinyl window replacements provide a pretty similar return to siding at 74.3 percent and will help make sure that your new siding doesn&rsquo;t clash with dated windows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Bathroom remodel<br /></strong></h2>
<p>A mid-range bathroom remodel (think updated tile, fixtures, toilet, counters, and lighting) will get you a return of 70.1 percent nationally. And like the kitchen, doing more doesn&rsquo;t equal getting more. An upscale bathroom remodel is only going to get you a 56.2 percent return, and a new bathroom addition just 54.6 percent.</p>
<p>Another of the most value home improvements in terms of bathroom remodels is turning your standard bathroom into a&nbsp;universally accessible one. This includes widening doorways for wheelchairs, putting in a walk-in shower, lowering light switches, and putting support bars near the toilet. While this might not seem like something that would be relevant for most of today&rsquo;s buyers, it will be very soon.&nbsp;We&nbsp;live in an aging society. By 2050,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.census.gov/prod/2014pubs/p25-1140.pdf">it&rsquo;s estimated</a>&nbsp;that the population aged 65 and over will be more than double its population in 2012, growing from 43.1 million to 83.7 million. Small accessibility modifications will have major appeal as homeowners and buyers grow older.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking to make the best and most valuable home improvements, take a look at the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2018/">2018 Cost vs. Value Report</a>&nbsp;and hone in on your specific region and city. While we&rsquo;ve been looking at national data, specific upgrades may have more or less value depending on where you live. It&rsquo;s always important to do the research instead of just assuming that something will definitely give you a return on your investment.</p>
